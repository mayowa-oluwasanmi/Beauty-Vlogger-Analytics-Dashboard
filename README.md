# ðŸ“Š Beauty Youtuber Analytics
This Streamlit dashboard app uses mock Youtube channel data to display metrics and visualisations of a hypothetical content creator. The dashboard shows the real life tragectory of a beauty youtuber from the 2010s to the 2020s. It shows modest growth between 2010-2015, with a big spike in views and virality during 2016's Youtube beauty era. It also shows the slow plateau towards eventual decline of Beauty Youtube, especially from 2021-present due to TikTok.

UI is built with **Streamlit**.
